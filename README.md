# ReSharper Report Prettier

A tool that converts the XML report produced by JetBrains command line InspectCode tool into a beautiful readable HTML report.

The free JetBrains CLI InspectCode tool produces an XML report which is meant for integration with other software tools (CI/CD).
However, developers may not have any other tools and/or want to inspect this output directly.

Using the script provided, the initial XML report is converted into an HTML report which leverages popular frontend libraries such us Bootstrap and Bootstrap-table to beautify the output and provide searching and filtering capabilities.

This work is inspired by scripts created by Maarten Balliauw ([maartenba](https://github.com/maartenba)).

## Usage/Examples
Create the XML report with JetBrains InspectCode tool. This tool offers several options but, as an example, the following command will inspect the `.cs` files a project named `FancyProjectName` included in a solution stored in `FullPathToFancySolution`. After running, the tool will provide a report called `InspectCodeResult.xml` in the root of the solution path:
````Powershell
PS> jb inspectcode --build --project=FancyProjectName --no-swea --format=xml --output=InspectCodeResult.xml --include=**\*.cs "FullPathToFancySolution"
````
Then, navigate to folder where `Create-Report.ps1` script is and run the following command: 
```Powershell
PS> .\Create-Report.ps1 "PathToInspectCodeResult.xml"
```

## Screenshots
The screenshot of HTML reports shown below was generated by running ReSharper InspectCode tool on a couple of projects cloned from GitHub.

Actual report files along with initial XML can be found in examples folder.
